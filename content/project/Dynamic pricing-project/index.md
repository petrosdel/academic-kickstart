title: Recovering Utilities from observational data 
summary:  We consider the problem of inverse reinforcement learning in an economic environment where the agent is a consumer who maximises their utility by choosing what to consume and is constrained by how much they can afford.   The project is funded by just-eat plc and the results have immediate applications in retail, aviation and hotel industries.
